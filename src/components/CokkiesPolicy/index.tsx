                  This website uses cookies. Cookies are small files containing
                  certain information that are stored on your device. Cookies
                  are served either by LogciNimbus or Tunk.ai. (collectively
                  &quot;LogicNimbus&quot;) &ndash; so-called &quot;first party
                  cookies&quot; &ndash; or by third parties providing services

                  Cookies are necessary to provide certain functionalities on a
                  website, e.g. to maintain a language choice made by a user.
                  Moreover, cookies enable the respective issuer (LogicNimbus or
                  a third party) to recognize that the website was previously
                  called up by a certain end device, allowing the identification
                  of returning visitors (or rather their end devices) and
                  gathering information about their usage of the website and
                  their presumed interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This information is used to improve the website and to deliver
                  relevant advertisement for LogicNimbus products and services
                  on the website as well as on third party sites.

                  Cookies can be assigned to four categories, depending on their
                  function and intended purpose: strictly necessary cookies,
                  performance cookies, functionality cookies, and marketing
                  cookies.

                <p className="my-2 font-bold">Strictly Necessary Cookies</p>
                <p>
                  These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move
                  around the website and use its features, such as setting your
                  privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. Without
                  these cookies, services requested through usage of our website
                  cannot be properly provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Strictly necessary cookies do not require consent from the
                  user under applicable law. You may configure your web browser
                  to block strictly necessary cookies, but you might then not be
                  able to use the website’s functionalities as intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To the extent that information processed in connection with
                  strictly necessary cookies should qualify as personal data in
                  a given case, the legal ground for that processing is
                  LogicNimbus legitimate interest to operate the website.

                <p className="my-2 font-bold">Performance Cookies</p>
                <p>
                  These cookies collect information about how visitors use a
                  website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often,
                  and how visitors move around the site. They help us to better
                  understand a user’s behavior on our webpage. This is necessary
                  to improve the user friendliness of a website and therefore
                  enhance the user’s experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Further information collected by performance cookies may
                  include e.g.: internet browser and operating system used, the
                  domain name of the website which you previously visited, the
                  number of visits, average duration of visit, and pages called
                  up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In general, the information collected by these cookies is
                  aggregated and can normally not be linked to a specific
                  natural person. However, in certain cases the collected
                  information can be linked to you directly (provided you
                  disclosed your identity to LogicNimbus, e.g., when creating an
                  account or filing a request with us). To the extent that
                  information processed in connection with performance cookies
                  can, in a given case, be directly linked to you or otherwise
                  qualifies as personal data, the legal ground for that
                  processing is your user consent.

                <p className="my-2 font-bold">Functionality Cookies</p>
                <p>
                  These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make
                  or information you enter (such as your username, language or
                  the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal
                  features. They are also used to enable requested functions
                  such as playing videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To the extent that information processed in connection with
                  functionality cookies should, in a given case, qualify as
                  personal data, the legal ground for that processing is the
                  user’s consent.
                </p>
                <p className="my-2 font-bold">Marketing Cookies</p>
                <p>
                  Marketing cookies (also referred to as targeting or
                  advertising cookies) are used to deliver adverts on third
                  party websites more relevant to you and your interests. They
                  are also used to limit the number of times you see an
                  advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an
                  advertising campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Legal basis for the processing of personal data in connection
                  with marketing cookies (if any) is the user’s consent.
